## Key Numbers to Remember

### BASELINE (Phase 1-2 Complete)
- **Tokens:** 237.5K per cycle
- **Cost:** $0.594 per cycle
- **Time:** 12 minutes
- **Daily:** 30 cycles capacity

### PHASE 3 TARGET
- **Tokens:** 157.5K per cycle (-37%)
- **Cost:** $0.394 per cycle (-34%)
- **Time:** 11 minutes (-8%)
- **Daily:** 33 cycles capacity (+10%)

### SUCCESS RANGE
- **Tokens:** 155K-160K ✅ (within 5% of target)
- **Cost:** $0.388-$0.400 ✅ (on target)
- **Time:** 10.8-11.5 min ✅ (meets target)

## Timeline

| Date | Phase | Owner | What | Status |
|------|-------|-------|------|--------|
| 2026-02-07 | Baseline | Me | Document baseline metrics | ✅ DONE |
| 2026-02-08 | 3A | code-implementer | Integrate tool schemas | 🔄 IN PROGRESS |
| 2026-02-08 | 3B | phase-1-2-tester | Run 5 test cycles | ⏳ AWAITING |
| 2026-02-08 | 3C | Me | Analyze & report results | ⏳ AWAITING |

## What To Expect

### From code-implementer (Phase 3A)
- Tool schemas added to agent prompts
- Context7 descriptions replaced with JSON
- Report generation schemas defined
- No breaking changes
- ETA: ~4 hours work

### From phase-1-2-tester (Phase 3B)
- 5 test cycles run
- Tokens recorded per cycle
- Cycle time measured
- Cost calculated
- Any anomalies documented
- ETA: ~3 hours work

### From me (Phase 3C)
- Final report populated with real data
- Executive summary with top 5 KPIs
- Cost savings & ROI calculated
- Token reduction breakdown by agent
- Ongoing monitoring recommendations
- ETA: ~2 hours analysis

---

## Success Criteria (MUST HAVE)

✅ Token reduction ≥30% (target 157.5K)
✅ Cost reduction ≥30% (target $0.394/cycle)
✅ Cycle time ≤11 min (no regression)
✅ Zero breaking changes
✅ 5+ test cycles measured

## How to Help

### If you're code-implementer
→ Use `001-baseline-metrics.md` section "Phase 3 Implementation Target"
→ Share completion status with team-lead when Phase 3A done

### If you're phase-1-2-tester
→ Use template in `002-monitoring-log.md` "Test Cycle Data Template"
→ Record exact token counts, cycle times
→ Share all 5 cycle results when done

### If you're team-lead
→ Wait for final report (`004-final-report.md`)
→ Review executive summary (top 5 KPIs)
→ Check ROI analysis section
